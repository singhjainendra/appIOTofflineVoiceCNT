## Overall Learning 

During this course, I gained strong exposure to industrial embedded systems and communication technologies with IoT integration. [march 2025]I developed practical knowledge of microcontroller-based systems, specifically focusing on the ESP8266 NodeMCU and cloud integration[adafruit io].

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: Smart Home Automation With  Cloud Integration</h3>
<p>
The primary objective of this project was to design and implement a low-cost, scalable smart home automation system with dual controllability: offline voice control and cloud-based remote access[cusing MIT app inventer ]. The system allows users to control home appliances such as lights, fans, and doors through voice commands (using Android native voice to text) and a cloud dashboard (Adafruit IO).

## **Learnings from LST and SST**

LST and SST classes provided structured guidance on professional communication, work ethics, leadership, and emotional intelligence, helping me develop strong interpersonal and workplace skills. The sessions also covered digital presence, presentation skills, negotiation, and career planning, which enhanced my confidence and professional readiness. Advanced topics such as prompt engineering, productivity with AI, and creative problem-solving improved my ability to use AI tools effectively in real-world scenarios.

## **Community Services**

During my internship period, I engaged in various community-focused initiatives that supported social welfare and environmental care. I took part in blood donation to contribute to community health, planted saplings to encourage a greener environment, and provided assistance to an elderly individual in my local area. These activities enhanced my awareness of social responsibility and the importance of giving back to the community.

### **Activities Involved**
- **Blood Donation** – 
  
- **Tree Plantation Drive** –
